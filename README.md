## Hello-World
This is my hello-world Project in Github, and it consists of many .cpp texts about data structure implementation.

I'm a student in BUPT, and this project is made for learning deeper knowledge in data structure.
Not a professional project, but a note in learning.

Hope for advice and critisize.
